I'm an IT student and artist based in Germany :de:.

When I'm not programming, I like to draw and make music.

## FAQ :hand:

### Why .moe? :sparkles:

[.moe](https://get.moe/) is a fairly new top-levl domain extension that I happened to come across. Why did I decide to go with this? Because it sounded pretty decent.

A lot of interesting websites use this domain extension:

- [safe.moe](https://safe.moe)
- [guya.moe](https://guya.moe)
- [themes.moe](https://themes.moe)

### What does oaj/oatandjam mean?

It's a pseudonym that I created by omitting letters from my name. It doesn't carry any deep meaning.

### What games do you like? :video_game:
 
I don't play much but when I do these are my go to games:

- Elona
- Osu!
- OpenRA

Apart from these games I tend to play alot of [visual novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel).
