I'm an IT student and freelance artist based in Germany :de: with some webdev experience.

When I'm not programming, I like to draw and make music.

## FAQ :hand:

### Why .moe? :sparkles:

[.moe](https://get.moe/) is a fairly new top-levl domain extension that I happened to come across. Why did I decide to go with this? Because it sounds decent.

A lot of cool sites use this extension:

- satania.moe
- safe.moe
- guya.moe
- themes.moe


### What games do you like? :video_game:
 
I don't play much but when I do these are my goto games:

- [Elona](https://share.dmca.gripe/1ISLV8ZvDXM7N6WM.png)
 
- Osu!

- Doom (classic)

- Command and Conquer 

Apart from these games I tend to play alot of [visual novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel).
